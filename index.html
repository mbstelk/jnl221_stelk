		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Data Breach Hacks, Information is Beautiful</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Maddie Stelk: Data Breach Hacks, Information Is Beautiful</h3>

		<p>Q1:The data from this project is from multiple news sources, including the New York Times, Forbes, The Guardian, Tech Radar, BBC, PC Mag, and Tech Crunch.  The dataviz elements were created by David McCandless and Tom Evans to show the world’s biggest data breaches and hacks over the years. The two decided to make the y axis the year (from 2004-present) and use a bubble chart to demonstrate the correlation between the size and the number of records lost during that specific breach or hack (basically, the larger the bubble, the more records were lost). At face value, each individual bubble shows the name of the company/corporation that suffered from the breach or hack, but if you hover over it with a cursor, a small summary of what happened will appear inside the bubble. McCandless and Evans selected blue and yellow colors to fill these individual bubbles. The yellow bubbles mean that the story of the hack or breach is interesting or peculiar in some way. </p>

		<p>Q2:I think the key message of this project is to show how more and more data breaches and hacks are happening as technology continues to advance over time. The authors are trying to elicit fear out of their viewers and also bring awareness to an issue that many people are blind to, yet they still give out their private information to these companies and consume their content daily. </p>

		<p>Q3:I personally think that the bubble chart makes the data look messy and overwhelming because there are so many bubbles mushed together, but that’s the whole point of the message. Data breaches and hacks are much more common than we may think they are and when they happen, we panic and often go into crisis mode. The large sizes of the bubbles also help convey how big of a problem these breaches/hacks often are. </p>

		<p>Q4: When I look at this chart, I don’t just see blue and yellow colored bubbles- I somehow know that they are dangerous, and almost warning signs, especially because the names of the corporations are labeled inside of them. I think the chart does an excellent job of eliciting fear and disbelief and makes the viewer think “damn, this is really what our world has come to.” We are so reliant on tech companies to store our personal data and just ignore the fact that it isn’t a secure thing to rely on at all. </p>

		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here:-->

		<iframe title="Number of Queer-Friendly Locales in NY Cities, 1965" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-GXl0T" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GXl0T/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="745"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

 
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
