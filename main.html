	<h2>(In First Look, we pay a quick visit to a new restaurant or bar in Central New York to give readers an idea of what to expect. Our food critics might visit these places eventually and give us their take, but we want to highlight what’s new in our area.)</h2>
	<p>Syracuse, N.Y. — The cheesecakes that came out of Sherita Semple’s home kitchen were so popular that customers would drive up to an hour to pick up an order. One guy even rode his bicycle 6 miles from the city’s East Side to the Western Lights Wegmans parking lot for a turtle cheesecake.</p>
	<p>That grassroots side-gig that had sprouted from Sherita’s event-planning business has evolved into a new standalone shop next to the parking lot where she used to deliver her cheesecakes.</p>
	<p>Trita Treatz, a custom-order bake shop, opened Sept. 11 in a tiny spot in Western Lights Plaza, next to Wegmans and the Burger King drive-through window. It was once home to a Pizza Hut and later a locally-owned pizzeria before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. It sat vacant for a year until Sherita signed the lease in May. She added walls to the store and installed new coolers, countertops, mixers and ovens. (The name Trita Treatz, by the way, comes from her great aunt; that’s what she called Sherita since she was a child.”</p>
	<p>This business is entirely run by her family. Sherita works side-by-side with her sister Brandi Gary, and 15-year-old daughter Sa’rae.</p>
	<p>“For anyone starting a business now, it’s so much more challenging,” she said. “But I feel good about this. People like what I make, so I’m going to give it to them.”</p>
	<p>Sherita, who has worked full-time as a nurse’s aid since 2005, started an event-planning business in 2015. She would pay a baker to fill her dessert tables for each event. A couple years later, she started baking her own sweets so she could save her clients money on the overall event cost. At the time, she focused only on fancy cakes and candies.</p>
	<p>In February 2019, she made her first cheesecake.</p>

	<p>“This is going to sound crazy, but I don’t really like cheesecake,” she said. “I had to create a recipe that even I would eat. It took a while, but I did it.”</p>
	<p>Her cheesecake salads (creamy cheesecake filling mixed with fruit or other sweet ingredients) were an instant hit at the parties she coordinated. Once she perfected that, she moved onto full-size cheesecakes.</p>
	<p>During the pandemic shutdown, Sherita decided she wanted to spend more time in the kitchen and less time working at Crouse Hospital. Her husband urged her to open her own store, and he helped get it up and running.</p>

	<p>Everything at Trita Treatz is made from scratch. Each day, Sherita adds another few new desserts to the cooler, and she posts the menu and photos on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TritaTreatz" target="_blank">Facebook page.</a> Last week, she added a strawberry shortcake, lemon crunch cookies, brownie cookies, strawberry crunch cupcakes and butter pecan cupcakes.</p>
	<p>The cheesecake, though, remains the constant here. Sherita starts with a basic base made with cream cheese, sour cream, heavy whipping cream, eggs, corn starch and a “special vanilla extract.” The mini cheesecakes <strong>($10)</strong> are 4 inches in diameter and are 3 inches high.</p>
	<p>She makes several dozen of these each day. Customers can then choose what type of cheesecake they want. Last week, her flavors were: apple pie crumble, strawberry, strawberry crunch, turtle, banana pudding, and peach cobbler.</p>
	<p>Sherita puts your custom cheesecake together in under five minutes, often with the help of her daughter. “Sa’rae knows how to make EVERYTHING,” she said.</p>

	<p>Trita Treatz is already building a following. Sherita has already sold more than 200 cheesecakes for Thanksgiving. Last Friday afternoon, customers were showing up before the store opened.</p>
	<p>Ebonie Clark, a Syracuse resident in the nearby Strathmore neighborhood, was so happy with the red velvet cupcakes and banana pudding cheesecake she ordered that she posted a glowing review on the store’s Facebook page.</p>
	<p>“Listen, it was absolutely divine,” she said. “The owner is hands down the BEST at what she does. Trita offers exceptional customer service, extremely patient, personable and takes the time to explain her creations. ... I will be the first to tell you that she will be the next big thing!”</p>
	<p> <strong>TIP:</strong> Whatever you do, make sure you ask for a fork for the ride home. I live about 5 minutes away from Trita Treatz, and I started fishing through the bag after 30 seconds. The strawberry crunch cheesecake I bought for my wife ended up being three bites of a cheesecake by the time I pulled into the driveway. Oops. I can see why the strawberry crunch cheesecake is Sherita’s most popular flavor. The sugar and crumbs on top gave it a pleasant crisp to the soft center.</p>
	<p>I’ll be forced to make up for it when Sherita opens shop on Wednesday. Sorry. (Well, not really.)</p>
